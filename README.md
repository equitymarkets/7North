# 7North

"The original design and development of Bryn Mawr was an early form of TOD (Transit-Oriented Development), as were other Main
Line communities that developed along the Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. By re-enforcing
the TOD concept in Bryn Mawr, we are reconnecting the community with its origins. By promoting
transit-oriented development, there is potential to increase the number of rail riders and to realize a
better return on public investment in infrastructure and services."

-Sasaki, 2009

"We tried to unite public purpose and private profit, and if you can successfully do that, in anything, you've got a winner."

-Roye Lowry, 2009 from "Arlington's Smart Growth Journey"

The following is a feasibility study around existing infrastructure and design ideas for the 7 North Hotel, incorporating modern interior design with traditional local architecture.  
Since no two areas are alike, the main idea for the feasibility study is to find stations that are most similar to Bryn Mawr based on: 1) given distance from highways, hospitals, universities, and large employers and 2) population density and per capita income within the same or similar radius, and to analyze their success with lodging alternatives. 

## To-Do:

* College attendance ✅
* Rail Traffic ✅
* Pedestrian Traffic - inference
* Car Traffic - traffic along Lancaster Ave. and Bryn Mawr Ave. ✅
* Bus Traffic ✅
* Employee counts, major businesses - inference
* Employee counts, small businesses - inference
* PHL airport distance and ridership ✅
* Priorities


Micro benefits:
* Existing traffic, hospital, theater, colleges, businesses and seasonal markets provide a natural market for the project
* Resort-qualities bring in medium- to high-net worth clientele for a relatively affordable resort experience
* Is both enhanced by local tourism and enhances regional/national tourism

Macro benefits:
* Re-establishes town as a center of commerce, education, and tourism given surroundings
* Encourages increased usage of Paoli-Thorndale line
* Social image of a town must include lodging alternatives

Priorities:
* Pedestrian safety and connectivity
* Convenience
* Anti-Fragility
* Aesthetics
  

Challenges
* Amtrak lien
* Cost of underground parking
* 200 spaces temporarily lost during construction (see forcing points below)
* SEPTA funding issues and PAO threats

Study Challenges (Development of Proof of Concept) 
* Comparing data across metro services, boarding vs. total vs. unique - Boarding seems to be most readily available and should give a number close to unique trips. 
* Exact comparisons difficult - Note this in final draft including steps for best practices. 
* Comparing solely by town can be confusing - Use radius out from local train station to determine proximity of features.
* Ticket prices can greatly affect daily traffic to local stops, but may be unlikely to affect the propensity of one to actual hotel visits given an upscale hotel. 

Forcing Points - Forcing points should be considered as time contraints rather than actual threats. Most of them represent economic growth in the long-run, and will thereby benefit feasibility and profit for proposed project. In the short-run, however, they represent constraints that could possibly hinder development in the near future. So acting on this project before action is taken on other projects will be greatly beneficial to all interested parties. Some have large implications, some have much smaller, if any, implications. The point of this section is to consider all forcing points, regardless of size or impact. 
* Substitute parking situation should be implemented, utilized, and completed before construction of possible 2, 6, and 10 S. Bryn Mawr Avenue Project. In other words, the underground parking lot meant to replace Lot 7 should be operational before the mixed use project on the opposite corner begins, since that is the last remaining large source of parking overflow for existing Lot 7 Users. 
*  Ardmore Hotel possibility - competition during the critical first years of operation
*  College closure situation (e.g. Cabrini and other metro-area schools such as Art Institute of Philadelphia). Rosemont College has announced closure. 
*  Possibility of adverse height restrictions, similar to recent restrictions implemented in Ardmore
*  Inevitable building downturn could cause funding to dry up, at least for a long business cycle
*  Alternative development on Municipal Lot 7
*  Increase or decrease of Harcum attendence - While a decrease could result in possible closure (see above), an increase could mean less parking spaces available for overflow during construction and Lot 7 closure
*  Norristown Speed Line reopens County Line stop after improvement, opening possibility of more public transit access to Villanova from competing hotel
*  Wyndam House in Bryn Mawr College reopens, providing increased competition, although small, for the local lodging market
*  Amtrak substation improvement slightly decreases local parking - BEGAN NOV. 2024
*  Continued unimpeded growth in Valley Forge/King of Prussia area, in particular, a glut of new hotel and conference space

Further research:
* 30th Street Station Improvements
* Possible Philadelphia 76ers Market East project (Jefferson Station) - CANCELLED PERMANENTLY
* Line extension to Coatesville
* New Norristown speed line KOP station
* County Line Station improvements and reopening
* Strong Towns Initiative and Transit Priorities based upon these ideas
* Growth near Radnor Station
* Urban 3 Consulting and similar
* Urbanism movement and 10 principles of intelligent urbanism
* Virginia's Bull's Eye concept around stations, in particular the Silver and Orange lines
* Concept of anti-fragility and the enhancement of this which this project brings
* Peter Calthorpe and TOD

Possible Partnerships - representing large organizations that may be interested in employee or executive packages for corporate retreats or employee lodging during travel

Step 1: Read and interpret studies of a similar nature, preferably for hotels inside of town centers, if not available, do similar projects ( 1 week )
Step 2: Decide on a good group of test results similar to Lower Merion Township from Step 1. Based on this, some similar areas are Westfield, NJ, Princeton, NJ, Arlington, VA, Tysons, VA, Evanston, IL, Bethesda, MD, and Chapel Hill, NC. Focus is on train stops/village centers and the radius around them, not necessarily the town or city designation of the addresses. All raw data extracted for Lower Merion Township should be extracted from test markets in as comparable form as possible. Conduct as synchonous as possible duplicate studies for the test markets. ( 1 week ).
    New approach: inputs: college students, hospital beds, local businesses, car traffic, train station traffic output: stations most similar to Bryn Mawr analysis: hotel rooms in output towns
Step 3:
Examining test results and all possible metrics with closest possible comparisons. 

Priorities, in order:
1. SAFETY - Concerns about past projects in Lower Merion have cited safety as a primary concern. As a busy Northeast town, Bryn Mawr already balances vehicles, trains, pedestrians (including joggers), and other modes of transporation, including bicycles and scooters. Safety, in fact, should be the primary concern in any new development, and any project should leave the existing environment safer than it was before. Some examples of this include expanded sidewalks with barriers against oncoming traffic, particularly along Lancaster Avenue, a sidewalk along North Bryn Mawr Avenue East to complete the interior sidewalk system around the property, the pedestrian tunnel from the train station (sheltered walk from traincar to hotel room, free of elements or car traffic), and possible crosswalks at the Northwest tip of North Bryn Mawr Avenue (near Santander Bank and Parvin's Pharmacy).
2. CONVENIENCE - 
3. ANTI-FRAGILITY - Properties must evolve. Transportation preferences change over time, and while a transit-oriented design is in focus, any surplus area should be available for quick conversion to alternative means. For example, parking spaces can expand or contract given market contraction or expansion. This future-proofing of the valuable underground space will support both increases and decreases in driving habits, as well as provide shared parking to other nearby facilities, including downtown retail and Bryn Mawr train station.
5. AESTHETICS - 

-While these are prioritized in order, it is fair to assume that all are equally necessary from a purely going-concern basis!

Definitely:
"old and the new"- outside (old) existing architectural styles of historic Main Line structures, inside (new) -modern, Asian-influenced, feng shui, modern Tokyo, Bangkok, Seoul structures, minimalist, practical
terrace idea
elevator top floor
year-round marketplace to embrace and improve (and in no way impede) Bryn Mawr Farmer's Market and Clover Market

Maybe:
conical or octagon roof at beveled corners
Atrium for Pool 2 area, retractable? if permanently outdoor, provide alternative winter use for covered pool area, not just plastic cover

Maybe not:
arched fiberglass walks
