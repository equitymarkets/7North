# 7North


Feasibility study around existing infrastructure and design ideas for the 7 North Hotel, incorporating modern design with traditional local architecture. 


## To-Do:

* College attendance ✅
* Rail Traffic ✅
* Pedestrian Traffic - inference necessary
* Car Traffic - traffic along Lancaster Ave. and Bryn Mawr Ave. ✅
* Bus Traffic ✅
* Employee counts, major businesses
* Employee counts, small businesses


Micro benefits:
* Existing traffic, hospital, theater, and colleges provide a natural market for project
* Resort-qualities bring in medium- to high-net worth clientele for a relatively affordable resort experience

Macro benefits:
* Re-establishes town as a center of commerce, education, and tourism given surroundings
* Encourages increased usage of Paoli-Thorndale line

Challenges
* Amtrak lien
* Cost of underground parking
* 200 spaces temporarily lost during construction

Study Challenges 
* Comparing data across metro services, boarding vs. total vs. unique - Boarding seems to be most readily available and should give a number close to unique trips. 
* Exact comparisons difficult - Note this in final draft including steps for best practices. 
* Comparing town names can be confusing - Use radius out from local train station to determine proximity of features.
